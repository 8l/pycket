A rudimentary Racket/Scheme implementation using RPython. It adds a JIT.

In order to do anything with Pycket, you need to check out PyPy:

$ hg clone https://bitbucket.org/pypy/pypy

Afterwards you can run the unit-tests as follows:

$ pypy/pytest.py

To produce an executable, run:

$ cd pycket
$ PYTHONPATH=.. ../pypy/rpython/bin/rpython -Ojit targetpycket.py

Afterwards you can execute a program:

$ ./pycket.sh program

See the comment in pycket.sh for more details.
